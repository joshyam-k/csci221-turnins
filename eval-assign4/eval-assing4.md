## 1 (Shell)

(a)

I would accomplish this by using the absolute path name inside of whatever command I am running. For example when running my `.c` files for this class I usually do so in the directory that directly contains that file so I'll do `gcc lab3.c -o lab3comp` but regardless of what working directory I am in I can run that same command using `gcc ~/Desktop/csci221-turnins/lab3/lab3.c -o lab3comp`.
